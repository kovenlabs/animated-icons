# Resume Task

## Description
Resume an existing task from where it was paused, continuing with the next incomplete mission.

## Usage
```
/resume-task
```

## Behavior
Loads and executes the resume-task workflow from `.ab-method/core/resume-task.md`

This workflow will:
1. Identify the task and read its `progress-tracker.md` (single source of truth — there are no mission docs)
2. Show progress: which missions are done, which is next
3. Load UBIQ + CONTEXT + tech-stack + patterns + ADRs for the next mission
4. **Run the next mission through the `tdd` skill** (red → green)
5. Append a tight technical summary on completion
6. **Run `review-implementation` after the last mission (interactive)** — three critics (cleaner-architecture, slop-defender, reusability-inspector) on the task diff; findings presented for you to apply before status → Completed
7. **Run `change-map` last** — derives the task's actual blast radius from its commits and walks the drift against the map drawn at plan time with you, before status → Completed

## Workflow Details
- The progress tracker carries the mission list and per-mission technical summaries from prior sessions — that's the entire context
- Tests + summaries are the persistent artifacts across sessions
- Always TDD via the `tdd` skill, never skip it
- Group-aware resume — if the next mission carries a `[pp-x]` tag, the remaining missions in that group are offered as one concurrent subagent batch (the user can still choose sequential)
- Change-map aware — the `## Planned` map written at task creation is read for orientation while missions run, and never edited; the actual pass appends to it once the task closes
- Black-box aware — if remaining missions are marked `⚠️ UQ-n`, the open questions from `unresolved-questions.md` are surfaced once at resume (answer now, or keep shipping the placeholder); answering one closes the entry and drops the marker

## Examples
```
/resume-task
# Finds the most recent incomplete task
# Reviews progress and continues with next mission
# Maintains all previous context and technical constraints
```

## Alternative Usage
You can also use the traditional AB Method master controller:
```
/ab-master resume-task
```
