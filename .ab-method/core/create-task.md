# Create Task Workflow

## Purpose

Create a focused task following the AB Method principle: one task at a time to conserve context and avoid redundant implementations.

## Core Behavior

**RESPECT USER INSTRUCTIONS AND KEEP IT SIMPLE:**

- If user provides clear requirements → Follow them exactly, don't ask unnecessary questions
- Only ask when something is genuinely unclear or ambiguous
- Don't overcomplicate simple requests
- Trust the user knows what they want

## Critical Step

**ALWAYS check `.ab-method/structure/index.yaml` FIRST** to find where task documents should be created.

## Process

### 0. Roadmap Awareness — standalone task or a roadmap task?

**Before grilling, figure out which kind of task this is.** Users phrase
the same request many ways ("create a task for the charge API", "plan the
next roadmap task", "let's build charges") — the workflow, not the
phrasing, decides. After reading `.ab-method/structure/index.yaml` (which
documents the task↔roadmap link in its `relationships` section), scan
`docs/roadmaps/*/roadmap.md`:

- **Roadmap task** — the requested task matches a `roadmap.md` entry
  marked `plan: ⬜ unplanned` (by slug, or clearly by scope). Then:
  1. Read that roadmap's **Objective** (its destination) and the entry's
     `depends-on` list.
  2. **Check `## Open decisions` for anything that `blocks:` this task.**
     A blocking decision means the graph around this task isn't settled —
     planning now produces missions the decision may invalidate. Say so and
     offer to resolve it first (`create-roadmap.md` § 2b): *"'refund-api'
     is blocked by D1 (fixed vs per-merchant refund window) — that decides
     what the missions even are. Resolve D1 first, or plan anyway?"* The
     user may still choose to plan anyway; that's their call, not a silent
     default.
  3. **Read `## Not yet specified`** — the roadmap's fog. If a patch names
     an area this task touches, the grill is the moment it may sharpen.
  4. Read the `progress-tracker.md` (Mission Summaries) of each **already
     planned** upstream dep — seed the grill with them so this task builds
     on what they established. If an upstream dep is still unplanned, note
     it: "‘charge-api’ depends on ‘stripe-schema’, which isn't planned
     yet — planning it first gives a better grill. Continue anyway?"
  5. Proceed through the normal steps below (grill → missions → tracker),
     writing the task under `docs/tasks/<slug>/` as usual.
  6. **On completion**, flip that task's line in `roadmap.md` from
     `plan: ⬜ unplanned` to `plan: ✅ planned`. If every task in the
     roadmap is now planned *and* no open decision blocks a task, set the
     roadmap **Status** to `Ready`. This keeps `create-roadmap` /
     `start-roadmap` in sync automatically — the user never hand-edits the
     roadmap.
  7. **Graduate any fog this grill cleared.** If the grill sharpened a
     `## Not yet specified` patch into something you can now state as a
     task, add it to `## Tasks` (`plan: ⬜`, with its edges) and delete the
     patch from the fog. If it sharpened into a question rather than a
     task, it becomes an `## Open decisions` entry instead. If it turned
     out to sit past the destination, move it to `## Out of scope` with one
     line of why. Tell the user what graduated — never reshape the roadmap
     silently.

- **Standalone task** — no roadmap matches, or the user is clearly
  starting fresh. Proceed exactly as before; ignore roadmaps entirely.

- **Ambiguous** — a partial/fuzzy match to a roadmap entry. Ask once:
  "‘payments’ roadmap has an unplanned task ‘charge-api’ — is this that
  task, or a standalone one?" Then proceed accordingly.

Everything below is identical for both kinds; only the seeding (from
upstream deps) and the completion write-back (to `roadmap.md`) differ.

### 1. Define Problem Statement — ALWAYS invoke the `grill-with-docs` skill

**Invoke the `grill-with-docs` skill on every `/create-task` invocation. No exceptions, no shortcut, no "the request looks clear so I'll skip it."**

Even when the user's request reads specific, the grill surfaces hidden assumptions, missing edge cases, terminology drift against `UBIQUITOUS_LANGUAGE.md`, and constraints the user forgot to mention. A clear-sounding prompt is not the same as a fully-specified task. The grill is cheap; an under-specified task that breeds wrong missions is not.

The skill handles the questioning itself — do not duplicate its logic here. It will:
- Walk the decision tree one question at a time
- Recommend an answer for each question
- Explore the codebase instead of asking when the answer is already in the code
- Read `UBIQUITOUS_LANGUAGE.md` / `CONTEXT.md` so the resulting task speaks the canonical domain language

It must cover, before exiting:
- Problem framing — what's broken or missing, who's affected, the trigger
- Scope — which files/components/routes/endpoints, what's in/out of scope
- Behavior — user flow, data fields, validation rules, error handling
- Constraints — patterns to follow, libraries to use/avoid, perf, testing requirements
- Existing-code anchors — similar implementations to mirror, types/services to reuse

#### How to keep the grill efficient when the user was already specific
If the user already named files, endpoints, or data shapes, treat those as given and let `grill-with-docs` *confirm* and *probe edges* rather than re-asking what was just said. The skill should still run — it just won't ask many questions.

#### Spinning off tangents during the grill
Grills wander. When a question opens a tangent that clearly deserves its **own** task — a separate concern, a different layer, work that would bloat this task's scope — do **not** chase it here and do **not** silently drop it. Capture it without derailing the current grill:

1. Invoke the `handoff` skill to write the tangent up as a handoff under `docs/handoffs/` (one file per tangent, kebab-case slug). It records the open question, the constraints already established, and why it was deferred.
2. Tell the user: "That's its own task — captured it as `<slug>`; resume it any time with `/create-task-from-handoff <slug>`."
3. Return to the branch you were grilling.

This keeps the current task tightly scoped while guaranteeing the tangent isn't lost. The handoff later becomes a task via the `create-task-from-handoff` workflow, which continues the grill exactly where the handoff left off.

#### Parking a question the user genuinely can't answer yet
**Rare — most tasks park nothing.** Sometimes a grill question can't be closed right now: the decision belongs to someone else, waits on data that doesn't exist, or is a product call that hasn't happened. The feature still has to get built. `grill-with-docs` handles this by **parking** the question — recording it in `docs/tasks/<task-name>/unresolved-questions.md` and agreeing a **black box**: a generic-or-empty placeholder behind a single named seam, marked `TODO(UQ-n)` in the code, that gets swapped when the answer arrives.

The skill owns the bar for parking (asked-and-recommended, real external blocker, a wrong guess would be costly, the rest of the work survives) and the file format — do not duplicate them here. What `/create-task` owes it:

- **Never park on the user's behalf.** A parked question is agreed out loud, and what the user approves is the *placeholder*, not the answer. Anything you could sanely default is not parked — it's a default, noted in the tracker's Constraints / Notes.
- **Write the file when the task folder is created** (Step 4) if the grill parked anything while the folder didn't exist yet.
- **Mark the missions** that build on a black box with `⚠️ UQ-n` (Step 5), so every later workflow can see a placeholder is in play.
- **Parking is not a handoff.** A parked question is an open decision *inside* this task, routed around now. A handoff is a tangent that becomes its *own* task. Pick by scope, not by how awkward the question feels.

#### Proceed when:
- Every branch the grill walked down is resolved — or explicitly parked as an unresolved question with an agreed placeholder
- Problem, scope, behavior, constraints, and existing-code anchors are all on the table
- The user has confirmed the gathered understanding, including any black boxes being shipped

### 2. Analyze Project Context

**CRITICAL: Before creating any missions, understand the existing codebase:**

1. **Check `.ab-method/structure/index.yaml`** for architecture doc locations
2. **Read architecture + domain documentation** to understand:

   - `UBIQUITOUS_LANGUAGE.md` (root) - Domain glossary; use these terms verbatim in mission names and descriptions
   - `CONTEXT.md` (root) or `CONTEXT-MAP.md` + per-context `CONTEXT.md` - Bounded-context boundaries; pick the right context for the task
   - `docs/architecture/tech-stack.md` - Stack, entry points, external services, constraints, testing
   - `docs/architecture/frontend-patterns.md` - Component structure and state management
   - `docs/architecture/backend-patterns.md` - API patterns and database approach
   - `docs/adr/` (if present) - Prior decisions; do not contradict without flagging

3. **Analyze relevant code areas** based on the problem:

   - Search for similar existing implementations
   - Understand file organization patterns
   - Identify reusable components/services
   - Check for existing types/models related to the task

4. **Extract technical context for documentation**:
   - Code constraints: File naming conventions, coding standards, linting rules
   - Architecture hints: Patterns to follow, services to reuse, integration points
   - Tech stack requirements: Required libraries/frameworks, versions, dependencies
   - API constraints: Endpoint naming, authentication patterns, data validation
   - File organization: Directory structure, import/export patterns
   - Testing requirements: Coverage expectations, test frameworks, file patterns
   - Performance considerations: Caching strategies, optimization requirements

### 3. Identify Task Type

Based on problem AND project analysis:

- **Frontend**: Client-side only
- **Backend**: Server-side only
- **Full-stack**: Both frontend and backend

#### Task Complexity Assessment:

**Simple Tasks** (Single mission - combine all steps):

- Adding a single field to an existing form
- Creating a basic CRUD operation for an existing entity
- Simple component styling changes
- Adding validation to an existing field
- Creating a straightforward utility function
- Basic text/content updates
- Simple configuration changes
- Adding a single endpoint that follows existing patterns

**Complex Tasks** (Multiple missions - break down):

- New feature with multiple components and backend changes
- Implementing authentication/authorization
- Complex data relationships or new entities
- Multi-step user flows
- Integration with external services
- Major refactoring or architectural changes
- Features requiring multiple API endpoints
- Tasks involving file uploads, payments, or complex business logic

### 4. Create Task Document

Based on `.ab-method/structure/index.yaml`, create a task folder with:

```
tasks/[task-name]/
  progress-tracker.md
  unresolved-questions.md   ← ONLY if the grill parked something; omit otherwise
  change-map.md             ← written in Step 7.6, once the missions are settled
  sub-agents-outputs/
```

If `grill-with-docs` parked any question in Step 1, write `unresolved-questions.md` now, in the format the skill defines (`UNRESOLVED-QUESTIONS-FORMAT.md`). Never create the file empty or with a "none yet" placeholder — its absence is the normal state and means "nothing is unresolved".

### 5. Initialize Progress Tracker with All Missions

Create `progress-tracker.md` — slim, no empty placeholder sections:

```markdown
# Task: [Task Name]

**Status**: Brainstormed
**Type**: [Frontend / Backend / Full-stack]
**Created**: YYYY-MM-DD

## Problem
[1–3 sentences from the grill-with-docs session.]

## Outcome
[1–2 sentences: what's true after this task that isn't now.]

## Constraints / Notes
[Only the non-obvious ones surfaced by grill-with-docs. Skip the section if there's nothing to say. Common contents: patterns to follow, libraries to use/avoid, perf budgets, files-to-touch hints.]

## Unresolved Questions
[ONLY if the grill parked something. One line per open question, pointing at the file:
`⚠️ UQ-1 — which currencies at launch? Placeholder: USD only. See unresolved-questions.md`
Omit the whole section when nothing was parked — the common case.]

## Missions
- [ ] Mission 1: [Layer] — [one-line specific description]
- [ ] Mission 2: [Layer] — [one-line specific description]
- [ ] Mission 3: [Layer] — [one-line specific description]

## Mission Summaries
_Filled in as each mission completes. Future missions read these for context._
```

Mission lines may carry an optional `[pp-x]` parallel-group tag (see Step 7) — only when the user explicitly opted in.

Mission lines that build on a parked question carry a `⚠️ UQ-n` marker, e.g.
`- [ ] Mission 4: Backend — refund endpoint ⚠️ UQ-2`. The marker is the signal to every later
workflow (`/resume-task`, `/start-task`, `/start-roadmap`) that this mission ships a placeholder.
Both markers can coexist: `... [pp-1] ⚠️ UQ-2`.

**Status flow**: Brainstormed → Validated → In dev → Testing → Completed

**Do NOT include**: empty "Technical Context", "Code Guidance", "Agent Usage Tracking", "Sub-Agent Outputs", "Notes" sections with stub bullets. The grill-with-docs session already extracted what matters; everything else lives in the architecture docs (`tech-stack.md`, `frontend-patterns.md`, `backend-patterns.md`) which every mission reads.

### 6. Define All Missions Based on Task Type and Project Analysis

**IMPORTANT: Define missions based on actual project structure discovered in Step 2, not generic templates**

#### For Simple Tasks:

**Create a single compact mission that includes all necessary steps**

##### Simple Frontend Tasks:

- Mission 1: Frontend - [Complete implementation including component creation, styling, state management, and testing in one mission]

##### Simple Backend Tasks:

- Mission 1: Backend - [Complete implementation including database changes, API endpoint, validation, and testing in one mission]

##### Simple Full-stack Tasks:

- Mission 1: Full-stack - [Complete end-to-end implementation including backend API, frontend component, and integration in one mission]

#### For Complex Tasks:

**Break down into logical, sequential missions**

##### Complex Frontend Tasks:

- Mission 1: Frontend - [Core component structure based on frontend-patterns.md]
- Mission 2: Frontend - [State management and data flow]
- Mission 3: Frontend - [Advanced features and interactions]
- Mission N: Frontend - [Testing and polish]

##### Complex Backend Tasks:

- Mission 1: Backend - [Database schema and core models]
- Mission 2: Backend - [API endpoints and business logic]
- Mission 3: Backend - [Advanced features and integrations]
- Mission N: Backend - [Testing and optimization]

##### Complex Full-stack Tasks (Backend First - Default):

**Note: We start with backend to provide ready types and data for frontend (unless user prefers otherwise)**

- Mission 1: Backend - [Core data model and primary API]
- Mission 2: Backend - [Additional endpoints and business logic]
- Mission 3: Frontend - [Core UI components using backend types]
- Mission 4: Frontend - [Advanced features and user interactions]
- Mission N: Full-stack - [Integration testing and refinement]

##### Complex Full-stack Tasks (Frontend First - If User Requests):

- Mission 1: Frontend - [Core UI and user flow]
- Mission 2: Frontend - [Advanced interactions and state management]
- Mission 3: Backend - [API matching frontend requirements]
- Mission 4: Backend - [Additional backend features and validation]
- Mission N: Full-stack - [Integration and end-to-end testing]

### 7. Offer Parallel Mission Groups (`pp-x`) — OPTIONAL, strictly opt-in

After all missions are drafted, check whether some of them are **independent of each other**: they touch disjoint files, share no type/data dependencies, and none consumes another's output. Independent missions can be tagged into a parallel group and later executed concurrently in subagents instead of one at a time.

**Never tag missions on your own. ALWAYS ask the user first** — they might not want parallel execution at all. Present the proposed grouping and let them accept, adjust, or decline:

> "Missions 2 and 3 look independent (disjoint files, no shared types) — want me to mark them as a parallel group `[pp-1]` so they run concurrently in subagents? Missions 5–8 likewise as `[pp-2]`. Or keep everything sequential?"

If the user declines (or no candidates exist), all missions stay sequential — that is the default. Skip this step silently when no two missions are independent.

#### Notation

Append the tag to the mission line in `progress-tracker.md`:

```markdown
## Missions
- [ ] Mission 1: Backend — core data model and primary API
- [ ] Mission 2: Backend — notifications endpoint [pp-1]
- [ ] Mission 3: Backend — export endpoint [pp-1]
- [ ] Mission 4: Backend — shared auth middleware (dep for the rest)
- [ ] Mission 5: Frontend — settings page [pp-2]
- [ ] Mission 6: Frontend — profile page [pp-2]
- [ ] Mission 7: Frontend — billing page [pp-2]
- [ ] Mission 8: Frontend — admin page [pp-2]
```

#### Semantics

- Same tag = same group = those missions may run concurrently.
- **Untagged missions are sequential barriers**: every mission above a group must complete before the group starts, and the whole group must complete before the next mission below it starts. In the example: Mission 1 → (2 ∥ 3) → Mission 4 → (5 ∥ 6 ∥ 7 ∥ 8).
- Missions in the same group must touch **disjoint files** — no two subagents editing the same file. If you can't guarantee that, don't propose the group.
- A mission must never depend on a sibling in its own group. When in doubt, leave it sequential.
- Number groups in execution order: `pp-1`, `pp-2`, ...

### 7.5 Pre-implementation Critique — ALWAYS invoke the `critique-plan` skill

Before asking the user to validate, run the drafted mission list past the domain model. **Invoke the
`critique-plan` skill** on every `/create-task` invocation — it spins up a read-only domain critic that
challenges the missions against `UBIQUITOUS_LANGUAGE.md`, `CONTEXT.md`, ADRs, and the architecture docs.

It is **advisory and opt-in-silent**: it pushes back only on genuine conflicts (terminology drift, wrong
bounded context, an ADR contradiction, a mission that reinvents a named concept). A sound plan gets a
one-line "No objections" — that is the common outcome, so don't treat its silence as a failure to find
something. When it does push back, resolve each with the user (amend the mission, or dismiss with a
load-bearing reason the skill may capture as an ADR), then update the tracker to match before Step 8.

The skill owns the critique logic — do not duplicate it here. It reads
`.ab-method/structure/index.yaml` for where the domain model lives.

### 7.6 Planned Change Map — ALWAYS invoke the `change-map` skill

With the missions settled (post-critique), draw the task's **planned blast radius**: which modules it
expects to add, change, or brush against. **Invoke the `change-map` skill** in its *planned* pass. It
writes `docs/tasks/<task-name>/change-map.md` with a `## Planned` section only — a plain-text diagram of
one row per module, its predicted verdict (`[NEW]` / `[extended]` / `[rewritten]` / `[touched]`), the
missions that reach it, the interfaces the plan commits to, the seams it crosses, and one sentence per
module on what it will do that it doesn't today.

This is not decoration — it is a **second read on the missions from the codebase's side**:

- A module you can't attribute to any mission means the plan reaches somewhere nobody accounted for.
- A mission whose row you can't place means the mission doesn't say where it lands.
- A module the map has to *invent* to stay coherent is a planning gap `critique-plan` structurally can't
  see — it judges the plan against the domain model, not against the file system.

Fix the missions when the map exposes one of these, before Step 8. Predict **only** what the plan actually
commits to: an invented module or symbol makes the later drift measurement meaningless, which costs more
than a thin map does.

The skill owns the diagram format (`DIAGRAM-FORMAT.md`) and the 10-row cap — do not duplicate them here.

### 8. Confirm with User

Show the progress tracker with all missions defined (reflecting any changes from Step 7.5) **and the
planned change map from Step 7.6**, then ask: "Task created with status 'Brainstormed'. Missions: [list,
one line each]. Blast radius: [n modules — k new]. Ready to validate and start Mission 1?"

The map goes in the same breath as the missions on purpose — the user is validating **where the task
lands**, not only what it says. "Wait, why does this touch billing?" is a question worth getting before
Mission 1, not after Mission 4.

If any question was parked in Step 1, restate the black boxes in the same breath — the user is
approving them, not just the missions:

```
2 unresolved questions — building on placeholders (docs/tasks/<task>/unresolved-questions.md):
  UQ-1 Which currencies at launch?      → USD only            (Missions 2, 4)
  UQ-2 Refund window fixed or per-merchant? → fixed 30 days   (Mission 6)
Answer either one now and I'll fold it in; otherwise we ship the placeholders.
```

When the user confirms, update status to 'Validated' and proceed to Step 9.

### 9. Execute Missions — ALWAYS via the `tdd` skill

Walk through the missions list in `progress-tracker.md` from top to bottom. When the next uncompleted mission carries a `[pp-x]` tag, follow **Parallel group execution** below; otherwise run the mission sequentially as described here. For each uncompleted sequential mission:

**STEP ZERO — non-negotiable, before any Read / Edit / Write / Bash for the mission:**

> Invoke the `tdd` skill via the Skill tool: `Skill("tdd")`.

Do this **first**, every mission, no exceptions. The skill loads `SKILL.md` (seams, anti-patterns, rules of the loop) plus its companions (`tests.md`, `mocking.md`), which drive every subsequent decision in the mission. Writing the test first is not enough — the discipline lives in that playbook. Skipping the Skill call means writing tests from instinct instead of from the playbook; that is a workflow violation, not a shortcut. If you find yourself about to read a source file or write a test without having called `Skill("tdd")` for this mission, stop and call it.

After the skill is loaded:

1. **Load context** (every mission):
   - `UBIQUITOUS_LANGUAGE.md` and `CONTEXT.md` — use canonical terms in code, types, tests
   - `docs/architecture/tech-stack.md` (incl. Testing section)
   - `docs/architecture/frontend-patterns.md` and/or `backend-patterns.md` — only the ones the mission touches
   - `docs/adr/` — prior decisions, do not contradict without flagging
   - Mission summaries from `progress-tracker.md` for what previous missions left behind

2. **Grill if vague** — if the mission's one-line description is fuzzy, invoke the `grill-with-docs` skill before implementing.

2b. **If the mission carries `⚠️ UQ-n` — build the black box, don't improvise it.** Read that
   question's entry in `unresolved-questions.md` first. Ask the user once whether the answer landed
   since the task was created; if it did, resolve the entry (mark it `RESOLVED`, record the answer)
   and implement the real thing. If it's still open, implement the **agreed placeholder exactly** —
   the one recorded in the file, not a better idea you had mid-mission. Then:
   - Put it behind **one named seam** (constant, function, config value), never inlined at call sites.
   - Mark it `// TODO(UQ-n): <question> — docs/tasks/<task>/unresolved-questions.md`, so
     `grep -rn 'TODO(UQ-'` finds every site.
   - Write the test against the placeholder behaviour and name the UQ in it
     (`describe('refund window (placeholder, UQ-2)')`) — a placeholder is still test-first work.
   - Update the entry's **Marker** line with the real paths once written. *In a `[pp-x]` group,
     don't* — group siblings never write `unresolved-questions.md` (concurrent writes conflict);
     report the paths in your summary and the parent writes them.

   Never fabricate data to route around a black box. If the mission can't proceed without inventing
   records or behaviour, stop and tell the user the question is blocking after all.

3. **Run red → green under the loaded `tdd` skill:**
   - Write the failing test first, at a seam the plan agreed (uses framework + patterns from `tech-stack.md` Testing section)
   - Make it pass with the smallest change
   - No refactor step — cleanup belongs to the post-implementation `review-implementation` pass, over the whole task's diff
   - The `tdd` skill drives the loop — consult it, don't improvise

4. **Optionally deploy a subagent** if the mission warrants it (large surface, specialized domain, infra). Pick by need — backend/UI/testing/quality/research — not by mission type. Default is direct implementation inside the `tdd` loop. A subagent does not exempt you from Step Zero — load `tdd` in the parent context first so the summary you receive can be evaluated against the playbook.

5. **No mission docs.** Missions live as one-line entries in `progress-tracker.md`, nothing more. The `tdd` skill drives the work; the test file *is* the spec.

6. **On completion**, append a tight technical summary to `progress-tracker.md`:
   ```markdown
   ### Mission N: [Description]
   **Status**: Completed
   - **Files**: [paths, only what changed]
   - **Built**: [what now exists]
   - **Tests**: [test files added; framework]
   - **Patterns**: [non-obvious patterns or libraries — skip if obvious]
   - **Integrates with**: [what next missions need to know]
   - **Placeholders**: [only if the mission shipped a black box: `UQ-n → <seam>` at `<path:line>` — skip the bullet otherwise]
   - **Gotchas**: [only real ones — skip the bullet otherwise]
   ```
   Skip any bullet with nothing real to say. A 4-line summary for trivial work is correct.

7. **Update CLAUDE.md** only if the mission introduced new features/pages, refactored structure, new patterns, new tech, build/deploy changes, or major API changes. Skip for minor fixes, styling, content updates, or trivial CRUD.

8. **Prompt the user** before moving to the next mission: "Mission N completed. Ready to start Mission N+1?"

When all missions are done, run the **post-implementation phase** below — `review-implementation`, then `sync-architecture`, then `change-map`'s actual pass — and only then set task status to `Completed`.

**Open questions don't block completion — they travel with it.** A task whose missions are all green is
`Completed` even with open `UQ-n` entries; the placeholders are shipped, deliberate, and recorded. Say so
in the closing message and point at the file:

```
Task completed — 2 black boxes still open (docs/tasks/<task>/unresolved-questions.md):
  UQ-1 currencies → USD only        src/billing/currency.ts:8
  UQ-2 refund window → fixed 30 days  src/billing/refund.ts:14
Answer either one and run /extend-task to swap it in.
```

#### Post-implementation review — invoke the `review-implementation` skill

Once the last mission is green, **invoke the `review-implementation` skill** on the task's diff (the
cohesive change across all missions). It spins up three read-only critics in parallel —
`cleaner-architecture`, `slop-defender`, `reusability-inspector` — that push back only on real issues
(shallow modules the change introduced, AI code-slop, reinvented logic). A clean diff produces no
findings; that's the normal case.

`/create-task` is interactive, so run the skill in **interactive mode**: it presents findings grouped by
lens (each marked `safe-fix` / `needs-judgment`) and you apply what the user approves, keeping tests
green. (Autonomous runs via `/start-task` instead auto-apply safe fixes and write a `review.md` — that's
the skill's other mode.) The skill owns the review logic; don't duplicate it here.

#### Documentation sync — invoke the `sync-architecture` skill

After the review, **invoke the `sync-architecture` skill** on the same task diff. It spins up one
read-only detector that finds what the change introduced that the architecture/domain docs don't yet
capture — new endpoints, patterns, dependencies, domain terms, ADR-worthy decisions — each routed to the
exact doc it belongs in. A task that introduced nothing doc-worthy produces no deltas; that's the normal
case. Run it in **interactive mode**: it presents the proposed doc additions (marked `safe-add` /
`needs-judgment`) and you apply the `safe-add`s the user approves, while `needs-judgment` items (prose
deprecation, domain reshapes, ADRs) are pointed at `/update-architecture` / `/domain-model` rather than
applied. This replaces the ad-hoc "remember to update the docs" step — the skill owns the detection and
routing logic. (Autonomous runs via `/start-task` apply append-only safe-adds and defer the rest.)

#### Actual change map + drift — invoke the `change-map` skill (actual pass)

**Last**, after the review and the doc sync — both of which commit changes of their own, so the diff isn't
final until they're done — **invoke the `change-map` skill** in its *actual* pass. It derives the same
diagram from the task's real commit range and appends `## Actual` and `## Drift` to
`docs/tasks/<task-name>/change-map.md`, leaving the `## Planned` section from Step 7.6 untouched.

**The drift is the point.** Walk it with the user before setting the task `Completed`:

- **Unplanned modules** — the task reached somewhere the plan didn't. Usually a real requirement found
  mid-mission (and often worth a `CONTEXT.md` line); occasionally a leak worth undoing.
- **Predicted but untouched** — either the plan over-drew the scope, or a mission claimed that module and
  didn't deliver. Re-read that mission's summary before closing the task.
- **Escalated verdicts** — a `[touched]` that became a `[rewritten]`; the plan under-read the work.

The skill only reports; it never fixes. Route what it finds (`/improve-codebase-architecture` for a module
changes keep leaking into, `/domain-model` for a crossed context boundary) rather than acting inside it. A
task that landed where it was planned produces one line of drift — that's the common, good outcome.

The `## Actual` block is also what goes at the top of this task's PR body.

#### Parallel group execution (`pp-x` missions)

When the next uncompleted mission is tagged `[pp-x]`, collect **all uncompleted missions sharing that tag** and run them as one concurrent batch:

1. **STEP ZERO still applies** — invoke `Skill("tdd")` in the parent context first. Subagents don't exempt you; you need the playbook loaded to evaluate the summaries they return.
2. **Confirm with the user** before launching: "Missions N–M are grouped `[pp-x]` — run them in parallel now, or one at a time?" The tag records *permission*, not *obligation*; the user may still choose sequential.
3. **Load shared context once** (UBIQ, CONTEXT, tech-stack, relevant patterns, ADRs, prior mission summaries), then **spawn one subagent per mission in a single message** so they actually run concurrently. Each subagent prompt must include:
   - The mission's one-line objective plus the relevant constraints/notes from the tracker
   - The instruction to follow the `tdd` red → green discipline: failing test first at a seam the plan agreed, smallest change to green, no refactor step (cleanup is `review-implementation`'s job)
   - Which architecture/domain docs to read (paths from `.ab-method/structure/index.yaml`)
   - The hard boundary: touch **only this mission's files** — its group siblings are running concurrently
   - If the mission carries `⚠️ UQ-n`: that question's entry from `unresolved-questions.md` verbatim, plus the instruction to implement the **recorded placeholder** behind one named seam marked `TODO(UQ-n)` — never to invent an answer or fabricate data (§ 9.2b) — and to report the seam's path in its summary **without editing `unresolved-questions.md`** (same reason siblings don't touch the tracker: concurrent writes conflict)
   - Where to write its detailed output: `docs/tasks/[task-name]/sub-agents-outputs/mission-N-[slug].md`, returning only a tight technical summary
4. **Verify the merge** when all subagents return: run the test suite once at the parent level to catch cross-mission breakage. If anything conflicts, fix it in the parent context before proceeding.
5. **Append each mission's technical summary** to the tracker (same format as § 9.6, one block per mission) and mark every mission in the group complete. If any sibling built a black box, write its reported seam paths into that entry's **Marker** line in `unresolved-questions.md` now — the parent is the only writer of that file during a group, for the same reason it's the only writer of the tracker.
6. **Prompt the user once per group**, not per mission: "Missions N–M (`[pp-x]`) completed in parallel. Ready to continue with Mission M+1?"

## Key Principles

- **Always grill** — `/create-task` invokes `grill-with-docs` on every invocation, no skip
- **Map the blast radius twice** — `change-map` predicts which modules the missions will land in *before* the user validates the plan, and derives the same map from the real diff *after* the reviewers pass. The drift between the two is the method's only measurement of whether a plan understood its own reach; it is reported and routed, never silently fixed
- **Always TDD, skill loaded first** — every mission begins with `Skill("tdd")` before any other tool call; the playbook (seams, anti-patterns, loop rules, `tests.md`, `mocking.md`) is what makes it TDD, not the act of writing a test first
- **No mission docs** — missions live as one-line entries in `progress-tracker.md`, completion summaries are tight bullets
- **One task at a time** — focus, conserve context
- **All missions defined upfront** — full roadmap at task creation
- **Backend first for full-stack** — types and data ready for the frontend
- **Subagents only when warranted** — direct implementation is the default; pick agents by need, not by mission type
- **Parallel groups are opt-in** — never tag missions `[pp-x]` without asking the user; sequential is the default, untagged missions are barriers, group siblings must touch disjoint files
- **Park, never guess** — the rare question the user genuinely can't answer yet is parked in `unresolved-questions.md` with an agreed placeholder and a `TODO(UQ-n)` seam, so the build proceeds without a silent invented decision. Parking is agreed out loud and stays rare; anything with a sane default is a default, not a black box

## Vague vs. specific

Vague requests trigger `grill-with-docs`. Examples:
- "Make it better" / "Fix the bug" / "Add some tests" / "Improve performance" / "Refactor the code"

Specific requests skip `grill-with-docs` and go straight to Step 2:
- "Add inline validation errors to the login form"
- "Fix the 404 when deleting users from /admin/users"
- "Add unit tests for `paymentService.calculateTax`"
- "Add a required email field to the /register form, validate format, follow UserForm pattern"

## Remember

- Always grill, always TDD, never write a mission doc
- The planned change map is drawn from the plan only, never from code, and is never edited afterwards — being wrong on the page is what makes drift measurable
- Check `.ab-method/structure/index.yaml` for paths
- Read UBIQ + CONTEXT + architecture docs before defining missions, and again before each mission's TDD loop
- Every mission must specify a layer (Frontend/Backend/Full-stack) and a concrete one-line objective
- Backend-first for full-stack tasks (types feed the frontend)
- `[pp-x]` tags only exist because the user said yes in Step 7 — and even then, confirm again before launching a group in parallel
- `unresolved-questions.md` exists only when the grill actually parked something; its absence means nothing is unresolved. Missions building on one are marked `⚠️ UQ-n` and ship the recorded placeholder behind a `TODO(UQ-n)` seam
- Each mission's tests + technical summary together carry the context forward — no other artifacts
