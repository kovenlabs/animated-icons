# Resume Task Workflow

## Purpose
Continue work on an existing task. The progress tracker is the source of truth — no mission docs to read.

## Critical Step
**ALWAYS check `.ab-method/structure/index.yaml` FIRST** to find where task documents are stored.

## Process

### 1. Identify the Task
Ask: "Which task should we resume?" If unsure, list folders under `docs/tasks/`.

### 2. Read the Progress Tracker
Open `docs/tasks/<task>/progress-tracker.md`. From it, identify:
- Task status (Brainstormed / Validated / In dev / Testing / Completed)
- Which missions are completed (with their technical summaries)
- Which mission is next (or in progress)
- Any `[pp-x]` parallel-group tags on pending missions (same tag = user-approved concurrent batch; untagged missions are sequential barriers)
- Any `⚠️ UQ-n` markers on pending missions — those missions build on a black box; read `unresolved-questions.md` in the same folder for the question and its agreed placeholder
- Any constraints/notes from the original grill-with-docs session
- The `## Planned` section of `change-map.md` if the task has one — where the plan expects the remaining
  missions to land. Read it for orientation; never edit it

### 3. Display Resume Context
```
Resuming: <Task Name>
Status: <In dev>

Missions:
[x] Mission 1: [Name] — Completed
[x] Mission 2: [Name] — Completed
[ ] Mission 3: [Name] — next up
[ ] Mission 4: [Name] — pending

Ready to continue with Mission 3?
```

If the next mission is part of a `[pp-x]` group, surface the whole group and offer the parallel run:
```
[ ] Mission 3: [Name] [pp-1] — next up
[ ] Mission 4: [Name] [pp-1] — same group

Missions 3–4 are grouped [pp-1] — run them in parallel in subagents, or one at a time?
```
If some missions in a group are already completed, only the remaining ones form the batch. The tag records *permission*, not *obligation* — the user may still choose sequential.

#### Open unresolved questions — ask once, then move on

If `unresolved-questions.md` exists with `OPEN` entries that any *remaining* mission is marked
`⚠️ UQ-n` for, surface them before starting — a resumed session is the natural moment for an answer
that arrived since the grill:

```
2 open questions feed the remaining missions
(docs/tasks/<task>/unresolved-questions.md):
  UQ-1 Which currencies at launch?           → placeholder: USD only     (Mission 4)
  UQ-2 Refund window fixed or per-merchant?  → placeholder: fixed 30 days (Mission 6)

Answer either one now and I'll build the real thing — otherwise we ship the placeholders.
```

Ask **once**. If the user answers, mark that entry `RESOLVED <date>` with the answer, drop the
`⚠️ UQ-n` marker from the affected mission lines **and its line from the tracker's Unresolved
Questions section** (remove the section when the last one closes), then implement the real behaviour
(if the answer grows the scope beyond a seam swap, say so and point at `/extend-task`). If they don't, proceed on
the placeholders without re-asking each mission — nagging is worse than the black box. Questions
whose missions are already completed stay in the file; mention them only in the closing summary.

### 4. Load the `tdd` Skill — STEP ZERO, before anything else for the mission

Invoke the `tdd` skill via the Skill tool: `Skill("tdd")`.

Do this **first**, every resumed mission, no exceptions — before reading mission context, before grilling, before any Read / Edit / Write / Bash for the mission's work. The skill loads `SKILL.md` (seams, anti-patterns, rules of the loop) plus its companions (`tests.md`, `mocking.md`), which drive every subsequent decision. Writing the test first is not enough; the discipline lives in that playbook. If you catch yourself about to touch the codebase without having called `Skill("tdd")` for this mission, stop and call it.

### 5. Load Context for the Next Mission
Read (paths from `.ab-method/structure/index.yaml`):
- `UBIQUITOUS_LANGUAGE.md`, `CONTEXT.md`
- `docs/architecture/tech-stack.md` (incl. Testing section)
- `docs/architecture/frontend-patterns.md` and/or `backend-patterns.md` — only the ones the mission touches
- `docs/adr/`
- Mission summaries already in the progress tracker

### 6. Run the Mission Through `tdd` (red → green)
- If the mission's one-line description is vague → invoke `grill-with-docs` first
- If the mission carries `⚠️ UQ-n` → implement the **recorded placeholder** behind one named seam marked `TODO(UQ-n)`, with a test naming the UQ, per `create-task.md` § 9.2b. Never invent the answer mid-mission; never fabricate data to route around it
- Run red → green under the already-loaded `tdd` skill — consult it, don't improvise. No refactor step: cleanup belongs to `review-implementation` once the task's missions are green
- Optionally deploy a subagent if the mission warrants it (large surface, specialized domain). Pick by need, not by mission type. A subagent does not exempt you from Step 4 — load `tdd` in the parent context first.

**If the mission is tagged `[pp-x]` and the user confirmed the parallel run:** follow **Parallel group execution** in `.ab-method/core/create-task.md` (§ 9) — one subagent per remaining mission in the group, spawned in a single message, each running tdd on disjoint files and writing its detailed output to `sub-agents-outputs/`; then run the test suite once at the parent level to verify the merge.

### 7. On Completion
Append a tight technical summary to the progress tracker (same format as `create-task.md` § 9.6). Skip empty bullets. Then prompt:
"Mission N completed. Ready to start Mission N+1?"

For a parallel group: append one summary block per mission, mark the whole group complete, and prompt once per group — "Missions N–M (`[pp-x]`) completed in parallel. Ready to continue with Mission M+1?"

When all missions are done, run the **post-implementation review** and then the **actual change map**, and only then set task status to `Completed`.

### 8. Post-Implementation Review — invoke the `review-implementation` skill

Once the last mission is complete, **invoke the `review-implementation` skill** on the task's diff (the
cohesive change across all its missions). Three read-only critics — `cleaner-architecture`,
`slop-defender`, `reusability-inspector` — push back only on real issues; a clean diff yields nothing.

`/resume-task` keeps you in the loop, so run it in **interactive mode**: it presents findings grouped by
lens (each marked `safe-fix` / `needs-judgment`) and you apply what you approve, keeping tests green.
(The autonomous `/start-task` variant instead auto-applies safe fixes and writes a `review.md`.) The
skill owns the review logic; don't duplicate it here.

### 9. Actual Change Map + Drift — invoke the `change-map` skill

After the review (and `sync-architecture`, if you ran it) — their fixes are part of the diff — **invoke the
`change-map` skill** in its *actual* pass. It derives the task's real blast radius from its commit range
and appends `## Actual` and `## Drift` to `docs/tasks/<task>/change-map.md`, leaving the `## Planned`
section from task creation untouched.

`/resume-task` keeps you in the loop, so walk the drift with the user before closing the task: modules the
task reached that the plan never named, modules the plan named that it never touched (re-read that
mission's summary — a claimed-but-untouched module means the mission may not have done what it says), and
verdicts heavier than predicted. The skill **reports only** — route what it finds to
`/improve-codebase-architecture` or `/domain-model` rather than fixing it here. A task with no `## Planned`
section records `no planned map — nothing to compare`; never back-fill one from the diff.

Then set status to `Completed`.

## Remember
- The progress tracker carries everything you need; there are no mission docs by design
- `change-map.md`'s `## Planned` section is read-only from here on — the actual pass appends to it, never rewrites it
- Tests + technical summaries are the persistent context across sessions
- Always `Skill("tdd")` first, before any other mission work — never skip the load, even when you "know" how to TDD
- `[pp-x]` tags exist only because the user opted in when the missions were defined — still confirm before launching a group in parallel, and never invent new tags during resume without asking
- `⚠️ UQ-n` means a black box: ask once at resume whether the answer arrived, then build the recorded placeholder and stop asking. Open questions never block completion — they ship, recorded, in `unresolved-questions.md`
